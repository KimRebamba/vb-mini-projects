# Payment Feature Implementation

## Overview
This update adds a comprehensive payment processing system to the Motociclo Motorcycle Shop application. Customers can now input payment amounts and receive calculated change, with all payment details included in the receipt.

## New Features

### 1. Payment Form
- **File**: `PaymentForm.vb`
- **Purpose**: Handles payment amount input and change calculation
- **Features**:
  - Real-time change calculation
  - Input validation (numbers and decimal points only)
  - Visual feedback for insufficient payment
  - Professional payment processing interface

### 2. Enhanced Receipt Generation
- **File**: `SimpleReceiptGenerator.vb` (updated)
- **New Methods**:
  - `GenerateTextReceiptWithPayment()` - Generates receipt with payment details
  - `ShowTextReceiptWithPayment()` - Displays receipt with payment information
  - `CreateReceiptContentWithPayment()` - Creates receipt content with payment details

### 3. Database Updates
- **File**: `Payment_Records_Table.sql`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `payment_amount` and `payment_change` columns to `Orders` table
  - Removed redundant `Payment_Records` table (payment info now stored in Orders table)
  - Simplified database structure for better performance

## How It Works

### Payment Flow
1. Customer selects a motorcycle and adds to cart
2. Customer proceeds to checkout and selects payment method
3. Order is created with "pending" payment status
4. Payment form opens automatically
5. Customer enters payment amount
6. System calculates and displays change in real-time
7. Customer confirms payment
8. Payment is processed and recorded in database
9. Receipt is generated with payment details
10. Order status is updated to "paid"

### Payment Form Features
- **Amount Input**: Pre-filled with total amount, customer can modify
- **Real-time Calculation**: Change is calculated automatically as customer types
- **Validation**: Only allows valid numeric input
- **Visual Feedback**: 
  - Green change amount for sufficient payment
  - Red change amount for insufficient payment
- **Professional Interface**: Clean, user-friendly design

### Receipt Enhancements
The receipt now includes:
- Amount Paid
- Change Given
- Payment Method
- Payment Status
- All original order details

## Database Schema

### Orders Table (Updated)
- Added `payment_amount` column to store the actual amount paid
- Added `payment_change` column to store the change amount
- Payment information is now consolidated in the Orders table for better performance

## Installation Instructions

1. **Database Setup**:
   - Run the `Payment_Records_Table.sql` script in your MySQL database
   - This will add the necessary columns to the Orders table and remove the redundant Payment_Records table
   - Optionally run `Drop_Payment_Records_Table.sql` if you have an existing Payment_Records table to clean up

2. **Application Files**:
   - The `PaymentForm.vb` file is already included in the project
   - The `SimpleReceiptGenerator.vb` file has been updated
   - The `home_page.vb` file has been modified to integrate the payment form

3. **Compilation**:
